# mapInterface
Explain the difference in HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap


In Hashmap if you print out keys they can be in any order(May not be in the order in which they put)

In TreeMap if you print out keys they will be printed out in Order(Independent of how you put them in)

In LinkedHashMap if you print out keys they will be in order in which you put them.

Result of code would be:

You can check how data entered in map interface in .java file in src and how they printed out here
hashMap: [Akshay, Daisy, Ayan, Zara, Mahnaz]
treeMap: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
LinkedHashMap: [-1, -2, -6, 0, 1]
